# SuperBin
File sharing, url shortener and pastebin all in one place with QR code and curl support. Uses stream based cryptography and data processing that can handle gigabytes of data with fixed memory and cpu usage. It can run on anything including PaaS like repl.it or Render and is very easy to customize.

# Why it's better than other similar apps :zap:
- works in mobile browsers, can upload file / text with ctrl+v, drag and drop, browse file or through terminal
- Support password authentication (for both upload & download)
- Extremely easy to set up, all you need is `go build .` or use the docker-compose.yaml and it's done
- Very easy for modifications, don't like the style? pick a .css file from [here](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css) and replace the `static/theme.css`, don't like the layout? the html page is well commented and structured
- Can run on any OS or deployment platforms like repl.it, render, fly.io, etc
- Encryption done right, password protected data are secured with AES & pbkdf2
- Decryption is done on the fly, the encrypted data is never decrypted to the disk
- Short & unambiguous URL generation (with letters like ilI1 omitted) with collision detection
- QR code support to quickly share files to / between mobile devices

# URL shortener 🔗
simply paste any valid url (must start with `http://` or `https://`) to the textbox and upload

# Dont like how it looks? 🎨
pick a .css file from [here](https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css) and replace the `static/theme.css`, or search for "classless css"

# How to build with docker :whale2:
1. Download / clone this repo
2. Make a folder called `uploads`
3. Run `docker compose up`
   
# How to build without docker 📟
1. Download / clone this repo
2. Open terminal
3. Run `go build .`

# Settings ⚙️
You can modify the variables inside `data/settings.json`
- `fileSizeLimitMB` = limit file size (in megabytes)
- `textSizeLimitMB` = limit text size (in megabytes)
- `streamSizeLimitKB` = limit file encryption, decryption, upload & download buffer stream size (in kb) to limit memory usage
- `streamThrottleMS` = add throttle to the encryption, decryption, upload & download buffer to limit cpu usage
- `pbkdf2Iterations` = key derivation algorithm iteration, the higher the better, but 100000 should be enough
- `cmdUploadDefaultDurationMinute` = default file duration if you upload file through curl if duration is not specified
- `enablePassword` = whether to enable password or not for site authentication
- `password` = password value for site authentication, use a long password to deter attacks or use an external authentication server 

You can modify CPU/memory usage by calculating the memory usage / sec with `streamSizeLimitKB * (1000/streamThrottleMS)`, the default setting can handle 40 MB of data/second on file upload, download, encryption & decryption, you can tune this down if needed

# Curl upload ⬆️
example: `curl -F file=@main.go -F duration=10 -F pass=123 -F burn=true https://yoursite.com`  
Note that the duration, password, and burn is totally optional, you can just write `curl -F file=@file.txt https://yoursite.com` for quick upload. If your site is protected with a password, you also need to add `-F auth=yourpassword`

# Security 🔒
For maximum security, it is recommended to encrypt your file before uploading
